## Disclaimer

If you want to seek workers who actually have experience with people asking questions, stay here and away from [this](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). I will admit, good points were stated in that article, however, it was very unprofessional and spoken in a condescending way. To be able to assist someone, is to first be able to understand that not everyone is as capable with technology as you are. This of course means, that you may not be able to comprehend your problem to the extend of being able to ask a question on it. With that, I will use my experience of working at a Help Desk to show you how to ask smart questions and how you may be asking not so smart questions. 

## When to Seek Help

If you are tech savy, go ahead and try to look for a solution yourself. This may be faster and more convenient for you when trying to troubleshoot a problem you are encountering. Since you know what you are doing, you will be able to get an idea if a method of troubleshooting is sketchy or not. However, if you are not as tech savy, I do suggest just calling someone more experience to assist you with your situation. This is the reason why tech support exist. You see, it sometimes becomes harder to fix a problem if a user has somehow made it worse to begin with. Sometimes it gets to the point beyond repair. We, the people who are on the other end of the line, understand that not everyone is as skilled at technology as others. We will patiently try and diagnose the situation with you to find out what might be occurring to you. So don't be afraid to reach out and ask, we will always be glad to assist.
