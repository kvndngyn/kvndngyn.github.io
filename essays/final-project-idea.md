# Project: WhatsUHp

## Overview
*The problem*: Many UH students are busy while on campus. It's the daily cycle of going from class to class, work, eat, then to hele[^1] on home. With a hectic schedule, it sometimes can be easy to forget about social interactions.

*The solution*: WhatsUHp (pronounced "what's up"), is based on the popular [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) and is a site where students can meet other students who go to the same campus. Although the main focus is going to be group chat rooms, students can also share interest on a community postings page. This is a way to encourage students to make connections with their peers and share fun stories they are dying to share. 

## Approach
Pau Hana[^2]? Students can create an account using their UH emails to join group chat rooms. These group chat rooms topics created by others such as "surfing", "student life", and "broken elevator". In these, students can join a group that allows them to talk with other people who share the same interest. If students don't see anything that interest them, they can always create a new discussion for others to join and chat. It's a quick way to make friends, plan events, and to dive into the diversity of the campus. 

 Dying to share a story? On the Community Posting's page, students can quickly share events or pictures of what they do. This can be things such as a recent events on campus, ghost stories of buildings, anything they want. This page will have these the post in a neat grid like fashion showing the most recent post on the top left. 
 
 Admins can remove discussions that are inappropriate to the site. Admins may also mark topics they take part in with "Admin Favorite" to help gather more attention to them.

## Mockup page ideas
Some possible mockup pages include:
* Landing page
* Student profile page
* Admin home page
* Create topic discussion
* Community post

## Use case ideas
* New student goes to landing page, creates profile, broswe topics/community posting's, join discussion, chat.
* Student goes to landing page, logs in, creates a topic, chat.
* Students goes to landing page, logs in, post to community posting's page.
* Admin goes to landing page, logs in, see's a inappropriate topic, removes it.
* Admin goes to landing page, logs in, marks their favorite topic with "Admin Favorite".

## Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
* Add a feature so students can add their interest and find those who share it.
* Implement a way for students to react to post in the Community page
