# Project: UH Advisors
This project idea was written in collaboration with [Jin Yan Wu](https://wjinyan.github.io/)

## Overview
*The problem*: Many UH students are left short of credits, have time to take extra courses, or even just incoming. However, not everyone wants to browse through a course catalog and read the descriptions to find out what interest them.

*The solution*: UH Advisors allows students to share their thoughts and opinions on the course they have taken. This will benefit the students looking for courses as they get to hear peer review of the subject. This application is meant to be fun and engaging for students to interact and possibly take courses together.

## Approach
From the get-go, students can get straight to searching for a course that piques their interest. They can do this by sorting by the most highly rated to a subject that interest them. One the initial card, students can see the course name, what campus and professor is the most reviewed, and the overall rating.

Want to write a review? Students can create a profile using their UH emails so that they can share their thoughts on a course that was fun for them. Course name, campus, and professor should be included because all those a factor when looking for courses. Students can also say what attributes it fulfills to kill two birds with one stone.

Admins can monitor to make sure that the reviews are given in a critical manner (not just bad talk) and make sure the courses are actual courses. 

## Mockup page ideas
Some possible mockup pages include:
* Landing page
* Student profile page
* Admin home page
* Browse courses by most popular or by subject
* Add course page

## Use case ideas
* New student goes to landing page, goes to browse and filters the reviewed courses by most popular/subject.
* Student goes to landing page, logs in, finds a course they took, reviews what was interesting about it. 
* Student goes to landing page, logs in, creates a course, leaves a review.
* Admin goes to landing page, logs in, see's a review that is vulgar or a course that is fake, removes it.

## Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
* Implement a chatting system for the students who are looking to chat with the students who have already took the course.
* Implement a rating system for student reviews and add it to the browsing page.
* Notify students if the course is available in the upcoming semester and when it is typically available.
