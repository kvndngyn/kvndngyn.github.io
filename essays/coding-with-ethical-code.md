## A "Glitch" or a Feature?
Prior to reading [*The code I'm still ashamed of*](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/#.tsjl7lkxy) by Billsourour, I have read a book for another course regarding Ethics in technology. This book was Ruha Benjamin's [*Race After Technology*](https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/race-after-technology) where it discussed many political and ethical topics surrounding technology and artificial intelligence (AI). One thing that is comparable between the two readings is when Sourour talked about the quiz. This closesly relates to Benjamin's discussion on "glitches" which is in quotes because it is much more than what is seen at face value. "Glitches" does refer to malfunction, but in this case, it was also used to study if these were intentional glitches or purely an accident. So how do these two tie together? Well, the quiz Sourour implemented had been designed in a way that seemed all choices led to the client's drug, with one exception, being allergic. Now to take Benjamin's analysis of glitches onto this quiz of Sourour's, we see that this was an intentional feature of the developers, but to those outside of the development, it all seems like a "glitch". I reccommend reading these two text to not only widen your persepctive on technology, but to also realize the many ethical considerations that need to be taken.

## Ethics in Software Engineering
Ethics is a tricky subject. Ethical viewpoints vary from person to person all coming from different moral backgrounds. Where one may consider a violation of their ethical code, another may consider normal to them. This is a big problem when going into software engineering as everything you develop should appeal to the ethical view of the general public. Ethics is without a doubt one of the most important things to consider throughout the entire process from design to development to deployment. To argue this point consider this text from [*What do we mean when we talk about ethics?*](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s20/morea/ethics/reading-se-ethics-intro.html):

>A failure of these critical software systems can result in death or grievous injury just as easily as a missing bolt or a poorly designed gas tank. This by itself is more than enough reason for software engineers to take seriously the ethics of their professional lives. 

Software engineers are not always the front face of the scenes, and it can be easy to glance over the fact that their role in jobs can have a huge impact. They must consider every step and make sure that the final product released will have the least risk associated with it. This reading continues to talk about many more examples that are not as fatal but just as important. The moral of this reading is to educate upcoming software engineers, or the public in general about the importance of ethics in development. 

## My Thoughts
After reading [*Five Ethically Constructive Habits of Mind and Action*](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s20/morea/ethics/experience-se-ethics-how.html), I have taken a much deeper consideration into ethics relating to software enginerring specifically. Of the five habits listed, I would like to share my personal reflection on the one I feel I am strong in, and the one I feel I need to improve in. 

#### Self-Reflection/Examination
This is already a habit of mine as I have previously hit one of the lowest points in my life. This was due to many factors including, but not limited to my actions and the actions of others. It caused a real steep drop in my work habits and ethics but it was also one of the most self-reflecting points of my life. The event had made me work harder than ever before and be ambitious with ever task I do. Every day, I ideally want to strive for something higher or push myself knowing I can do better. I want to become a person someone can turn to when they need help or to have fun with. This is my self-reflection.

##### Seeking the Company of Other Moral Persons
I believe I strongly need to improve in this. I am so used to always working in my own pace and  world, that I do not always stop and ask for help when I am in desperate need of it. As like others, there are times when even I need to rely on others for moral advice on my private and professional life. However, when it comes to it, I do not seek help of someone else. I just try to push through and solve it on my own which not only affects my time but the time of others. Take for example a group project. Let's say I am in charge of a task that needs to be done so someone else can complete theirs. If I get stuck on it, I would always try to do it myself and end up taking longer than planned causing the other person to wait longer. My neglect of reaching out to others for help affects everyone around me, and I always forget about it when it comes to it. This is something I would like to improve going into the future.
