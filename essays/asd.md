## Disclaimer

If you want to seek workers who actually have experience with people asking questions, stay here and away from [this](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). I will admit, good points were stated in that article, however, it was very unprofessional and spoken in a condescending way. To be able to assist someone, is to first be able to understand that not everyone is as capable with technology as you are. This of course means, that you may not be able to comprehend your problem to the extend of being able to ask a question on it. With that, I will use my experience of working at a Help Desk to show you how to ask smart questions and how you may be asking not so smart questions. 

## When to Seek Help

If you are tech savy, go ahead and try to look for a solution yourself. This may be faster and more convenient for you when trying to troubleshoot a problem you are encountering. Since you know what you are doing, you will be able to get an idea if a method of troubleshooting is sketchy or not. However, if you are not as tech savy, I do suggest just calling someone more experience to assist you with your situation. This is the reason why tech support exist. You see, it sometimes becomes harder to fix a problem if a user has somehow made it worse to begin with. Sometimes it gets to the point beyond repair. We, the people who are on the other end of the line, understand that not everyone is as skilled at technology as others. We will patiently try and diagnose the situation with you to find out what might be occurring to you. So don't be afraid to reach out and ask, we will always be glad to assist.

## Smart Questions Developers Should Ask

## Not so Smart Questions Developers Should Ask

Please refer to "[Wordpress Related Help Required](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59998618/wordpress-related-help-required)" to see a vague description of the problem. To start off, from the title of this forum, we really only know that they need help with Wordpress and there can be numerous amounts of problems that may be happening. When we look further into it and read the description, it still is very vague with what the problem is. It containts only 21 words to describe the problem but the description only says that one of the links listed is not performing like the other link listed. The user did provide examples of what they wanted, but since it was a website, whomever is trying to assist them will need to spend their time to try and look for what differences there are. This can be obvious at times and other times, not so obvious. The answer that was given seemed more as a troubleshooting tip to try and diagnose the situation to make the problem more clear, but it does not seem like a definite answer.

So how can they fix this? To start off, we would want to change the title so that it is more descriptive. The user should have stated what was going wrong with the website they were working on. For example, "Icon Button's Redirect Link is Not Working in HTML". That way, whoever is browsing through the forums might see it and immediately know the answer to it. In the description of the forum, I would clearly restate the specific icon that is not working and what happens when you try to click on it. Some example questions to go off of:
+ If this was working before, were any changes made recently that broke it?
+ Are you able to have it attempt to redirect you somewhere or is there nothing happening at all?
+ Do you get any error messages on your screen and/or console log?
The more you ask questions, the better you will get at it. You will notice that people will at first misunderstand you and maybe think that they do not know what they are talking about. What you need to take away from that situation is where they might have misunderstood you and where you may be able to improve your question to get the message across the first time.
